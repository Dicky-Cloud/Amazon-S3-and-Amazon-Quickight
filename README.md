# Created data visualizations using Amazon S3 and Amazon Quicksight, working with a large dataset of best-selling Amazon products
In this project, you will learn how to create visualizations from a large dataset using Amazon S3 and Amazon QuickSight. 

We will work with a dataset containing 50,000 best-selling products on Amazon.com, including categories, prices, customer reviews, and sales rankings. By leveraging Amazon S3 for data storage and Amazon QuickSight for analysis, you can process and present data more efficiently. This project covers the steps of uploading the dataset to S3, connecting it to QuickSight, and creating various visualizations to analyze trends and sales patterns. Let's get started and uncover valuable insights from this large dataset! 

# What you will accomplish
in this tutorial, you will: 
• Download the dataset and prepare the necessary files.
• Store the dataset in Amazon S3 for scalable storage.
• Connect Amazon S3 to Amazon QuickSight for data analysis.
• Create visualizations to analyze trends and patterns.

# Prerequisites
• If you don't have an AWS account, you can watch tutorials on YouTube or follow the official guide on the AWS website to create one.

# Implementation

This image shows a GitHub repository named techwithlucy/youtube with a folder called 2-s3-quicksight. Inside this folder, there are two important files:

Amazon-Bestseller-Dataset.csv

This is a CSV file containing data on 50,000 best-selling products on Amazon.com.
manifest.json

This is a configuration file required to connect the dataset from Amazon S3 to Amazon QuickSight. It typically includes information like the S3 URL of your dataset.
Download Steps
To download these files:

Click on the file name (e.g., Amazon-Bestseller-Dataset.csv).
On the next page, click the "Raw" button.
Press Control+S (Windows) or Command+S (Mac) to save the file to your computer.
Repeat the process for the manifest.json file.
Once you've downloaded the files, you can proceed to the next step, which is uploading them to Amazon S3.
